        <p>
          Founded on the belief that true success blends strategy with humanity, The Intersectional Business Academy emerged as a space where busy leaders and aspiring entrepreneurs could find tools, mentorship, and community support. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we have guided hundreds of professionals through transformative programs—supporting startups, advancing women in leadership, shaping inclusive workplace systems, and helping organizations align business intelligence with ethics. 
        </p>

        <h4>2015 - The Beginning</h4>
        <p>
          We started as a mastermind group for women leaders who wanted more than traditional networking. We focused on practical education, courage in leadership, and building confidence in business. 
        </p>

        <h4>2018 - Expanding Horizons</h4>
        <p>
          As word spread, our academy grew to support entrepreneurs, professionals, and teams seeking inclusive strategies for growth. This period marked our expansion into leadership training, organizational development, and ethical business consulting.
        </p>

        <h4>2023 - Today</h4>
        <p>
          Now, The Intersectional Business Academy offers programs for individuals and organizations across industries—helping them achieve measurable growth while staying true to their values. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="lead" id="anchor2"> Our Philosophy: </h3>
        <p>
          We believe leadership is intersectional—it must recognize the whole person and the multiple roles they play. We teach strategies that are both data-informed and emotionally intelligent, blending business rigor with empathy. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our philosophy is simple: growth should not come at the expense of well-being or values. Every leader deserves access to tools that empower them to thrive at work, at home, and in their communities.
