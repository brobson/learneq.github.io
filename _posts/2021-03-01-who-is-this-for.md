# Who Is This For?  

At **The Intersectional Business Academy**, we know that life and leadership don’t come with extra hours in the day. That’s why we’ve designed our programs, events, and experiences with *you* in mind.  

### Busy Professionals & Leaders  
For executives, managers, speakers, and those constantly in virtual meetings or networking events—our offerings support you in showing up confidently, prepared, and authentically.  

### Moms on the Move  
From chauffeuring kids to running side gigs and balancing family time, we see you. Our Academy gives you the strategies and community to stay grounded while excelling in every role you carry.  

### Social Connectors & Celebrators  
Whether it’s birthdays, bridal showers, retirements, baby showers, staff parties, team events, or holiday gatherings—our programs help you strengthen relationships and celebrate with intention.  

### Everyday Growth Seekers  
If you want to refine your leadership, communication, and presence—whether for high-end galas, fundraisers, or frequent social engagements—we help you build confidence that shines through.  

### The Wellness Reset  
When the pressure builds and life feels overwhelming, our community offers a space to pause, reset, and come back re-energized with clarity and strength.  

### First-Time Learners & Explorers  
If you’ve always wanted to invest in professional or personal development but hesitated due to “horror stories” about business culture, know this: we prioritize safety, inclusivity, and integrity at every step.  

### Gift-Givers & Experience Lovers  
Looking to give someone an unforgettable experience? Our programs and events create meaningful, transformative moments you’ll both remember.
